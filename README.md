# Rick and Morty
<h3><b>Golang/HTMX</b> website consuming <a href="https://github.com/afuh/rick-and-morty-api" target="_blank">Rick and Morty API</a>.</h5>

This repository was created to train the golang`s *html/template* library skills and learn the basics of *HTMX*. There will be no DB interactions, just a webserver sending outgoing requests to the api and listening to the incoming requests from the UI.

The secondary aim is to see the pros and cons working with *HTMX* library and its opportunities as an alternative of javascript and its SPA frameworks(e.g. React, Vue etc).

##
P.S. If you are reading this and you have any concerns regarding the functionality, or you are a forever learner and have some ideas to bring to this project, you are very welcome. I will be glad to hear any kind of feedback and will appreciate the opportunity to collaborate with you!
